- everything for the test is in the `password-reset` folder.
- start with [localhost:3000/login](localhost:3000/login)
- For hash/encrypt, I used `bcrypt`
- I used Chromium as the default brower for this test
- Everything should work perfectly, let me know if there is anything wrong :flushed:
- Thanks for all your help and patience during this session!!!
